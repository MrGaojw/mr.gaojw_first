We express our sincere gratitude for the editor and reviewerâ€™s diligent attention and acknowledgment of our research endeavors. 
We fully acknowledge the significance of data sharing as stipulated by SCI journals. However, owing to the policies and confidentiality agreements adhered to in our laboratory, we regretfully cannot furnish the complete raw data at this time. 
Nevertheless, we have meticulously presented a comprehensive account of the experimental design, analysis, results, and the procedures employed for data analysis and processing. Should the esteemed editor and reviewers require further elucidation or specific inquiries pertaining to the data, 
we pledge our utmost commitment to providing detailed explanations and clarifications. We are currently making some of the data and code available on GitHub and will share the raw data in full at the end of the project.
